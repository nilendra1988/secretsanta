Challenge:
Imagine that every year your extended family does a &quot;Secret Santa's; gift exchange. For this gift
exchange, each person draws another person at random and then gets a gift for them. Write a
program that will choose a Secret Santa for everyone given a list of all the members of your
extended family. Obviously, a person cannot be their own Secret Santa.
After the third year of having the Secret Santa gift exchange, youâ€™ve heard complaints of having
the same Secret Santa year after year. Modify your program so that a family member can only
have the same Secret Santa once every 3 years.


Solution:

I have used python dictionary to store previous year result of secret santa 
and then loop through this all the family members to assign secret santa.

For the first outer loop : every is elegible santa except them person himslef or if the person has give the gift to same person in past 2 years.
Eacg iteration of the loop will assign the eligible santa to the receiver.

For storing the mertdata and output ,for now i have used text file , but it can be chanaged to db connection or hdfs in future



Time complexity of the program in worst case is :  O(n)
