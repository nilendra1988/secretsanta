Challenge:
Imagine that every year your extended family does a &quot;Secret Santa&quot; gift exchange. For this gift
exchange, each person draws another person at random and then gets a gift for them. Write a
program that will choose a Secret Santa for everyone given a list of all the members of your
extended family. Obviously, a person cannot be their own Secret Santa.
After the third year of having the Secret Santa gift exchange, youâ€™ve heard complaints of having
the same Secret Santa year after year. Modify your program so that a family member can only
have the same Secret Santa once every 3 years.


Solution:

I have used python dictionary to store previous year result of secret santa 
and then loop through this all the family members to assign secret santa

Time complexity is  O(n)
